-- MIDI map for the Hercules DJControl. Albert Gr√§f <agggraef@gmail.com>, 2024

-- This is preliminary, to complement the hard-wired controls with some
-- essential functions. It also serves as a brief rundown of all these
-- bindings, while documentation on the DJControl support in Raptor still
-- needs to be written.

-- Hardwired controls: BROWSER encoder for preset selection (use SHIFT to
-- restrict to the currently selected instance); volume fader (mapped to MIDI
-- CC7 = volume) and filter knob (mapped to CC8 = balance); jog wheels for
-- scrubbing (pos/anacrusis); SYNC (set pos to 0) and CUE (reset the current
-- playback pos to anacrusis); Mode 2 pads (2nd mode button, typically "STEMS"
-- or "LOOP" on the latest versions of the controller, with pad 1-4, or 1-8
-- depending on the device) for selecting Raptor instances (ccmaster).

-- Mapped controls: Currently supported are the tempo faders and the most
-- important transport and looper functions: PLAY/PAUSE (playback toggles),
-- headphone buttons (mute), LOOP (loop toggles), IN, OUT (previous, next
-- loop), LOAD (load loop file), and SHIFT+LOAD (save loop file). These are
-- all available for both decks, and can be edited below or modified using
-- MIDI learn.
