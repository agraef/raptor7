-- This is my first attempt at an intuitive or at least a logical layout for
-- the LaunchControl XL. Enjoy. :) Albert Gr√§f <agggraef@gmail.com>, 2024

-- This maps the encoders in each column to the controls of the corresponding
-- row in the panel (1st column A = minvel, B = maxvel, Pan = velmod; 2nd
-- column = pmin, pmax, pmod, etc.). This works quite well, since the pan pots
-- are mapped to the mod controls in the third column of the panel, which are
-- mostly bipolar. The Send A and B controls are mostly mapped to ranges, so
-- that A controls the lower, B the upper value. Some rows have only a single
-- value (besides the mod value), in which case I mapped both A and B to that
-- value.

-- The faders are mapped as follows: 1 = hi, 2 = lo, 3 = mode (random, up,
-- down, etc.), 4 = pos/anacrusis (the "scrubbing" control), 5 = loop size,
-- 6 = meter numerator, 7 = meter denominator, 8 = division.

-- The four remaining CC buttons (send and track select) are mapped as follows:
-- up = rewind, down = raptor toggle, left = loop, right = play.

-- I think that this covers the most important functions that you might want
-- to use during a live performance. Of course, YMMV, so feel free to change
-- these around to better suit your style.
