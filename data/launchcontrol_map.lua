-- This is my first attempt at an intuitive or at least a logical layout for
-- the LaunchControl XL. Enjoy. :) Albert Gr√§f <agggraef@gmail.com>, 2024

-- This maps the encoders in each column to the controls of the corresponding
-- row in the panel panel (1st column A = minvel, B = maxvel, Pan = velmod;
-- 2nd column = pmin, pmax, pmod, etc.). This works quite well, since the pan
-- pots are mapped to the mod controls in the third column of the panel, which
-- are mostly bipolar. The Send A and B controls are mostly mapped to ranges,
-- so that A controls the lower, B the upper value. Some rows have only a
-- single value (besides the mod value), in which case I mapped both A and B
-- to that value.

-- The faders are mapped as follows: 1 = hi, 2 = lo, 3 = transp, 4 = raptor
-- toggle, 5 = mode (random, up, down, etc.), 6 = loop size, 7 = loop toggle,
-- 8 = division. Note that the toggles will be engaged for any non-zero value,
-- so they can easily be turned on and off with just a tiny fader movement.
-- You might want to remap some or all of these, if you use other controls
-- more often. But note that the meter (numerator and denominator) aren't
-- mappable. (Presumably these might be controlled via plugin parameters when
-- running in a DAW, via plugdata. In the future the meter might also be
-- picked up through Ableton Link, but the current Raptor version doesn't
-- support this yet.)
